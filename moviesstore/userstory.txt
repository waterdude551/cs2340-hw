User story: As a user, I'd like to post a "include movie petition" (on a separate page) in the movie store so that all users can vote on whether they want to see 
the admin add a certain movie to the catalog.

1. Log in or register an account.

2. Navigate to the Petition's page (or whatever you have named this separate page).

3. Create a new petition. 

4. Log out and log in/register into a second account.

5. Access the Petition's page and vote affirmatively on the previously made petition.

6. Log in/register into another account and verify that the petition affirmative vote was recorded --> the 'yes' count increased.
